## Credits

- I used a starter code developed by the bootcamp as the foundation for this project. I built upon the inital codebase provided to incorporate features and functionalities.  

- My tutor, Alex Gonzalez, advised me to adjust some code in my database.js file. He also told me to remove the period before 'src-sw.js' on line 30 in my webpack.config.js. 

- My TA, Enrique, told me to add publicPath: '' on line 20 to fix an error that I was having with my manifest.json file. 

- If I referenced an activity for a certain file, I included a comment that indicates which activity I referenced for each file at the top of that file.
